            <h3>WHAT IS A BROWSER WAR?</h3>
            <p>A browser war is competition for dominance in the usage share of web browsers. The "First Browser War"during the last part of the 1990s set Microsoft's Internet Explorer in opposition to Netscape's Navigator. Program wars proceeded with the decrease of Internet Explorer's portion of the overall industry and the ubiquity of different programs including Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge and Opera. 
                With the presentation of HTML5 and CSS 3, another age of program war started, this time adding broad customer side prearranging to the World Wide Web, just as more far and wide utilization of cell phones and other cell phones for perusing the web. These newbies have guaranteed that program fights proceed among devotees, while the normal web client is less influenced.

            <p>Further browsers were delivered in 1993, including Cello, Arena, Lynx, tkWWW, and Mosaic. The most powerful of these was Mosaic, a multiplatform program created at National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). By October 1994, Mosaic was "well en route to turning into the world's standard interface", as per Gary Wolfe of Wired. 
                A few companies authorized Mosaic to make their own Commercial browsers, like AirMosaic, Quarterdeck Mosaic, and Spyglass Mosaic. One of the Mosaic engineers, Marc Andreessen, helped to establish the Mosaic Communications Corporation and made another internet browser named Mosaic Netscape. 
                There are two times of the Internetâ€”before Mosaic, and after. The mix of Tim Berners-Lee's Web protocols, which gave availability, and Marc Andreesen's program, which gave an extraordinary interface, demonstrated dangerous. In two years, the Web has gone from being obscure to totally omnipresent. 
                To determine lawful issues with NCSA, the organization was renamed Netscape Communications Corporation and the browser Netscape Navigator. The Netscape browser enhanced Mosaic's ease of use and dependability and had the option to show pages as they stacked. By 1995, helped by the way that it was free for non-business use, the program overwhelmed the arising World Wide Web.Other browsers dispatched during 1994 included IBM Web Explorer, Navipress, SlipKnot, MacWeb, and Browse. 
                In 1995, Netscape confronted new rivalry from OmniWeb, WebRouser, UdiWWW, and Microsoft's Internet Explorer 1.0, yet kept on ruling the market.</p>

            <p> (Internet Explorer vs Netscape)
                The First Browser War (1995-2001) was an internet browser conflict between Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator (otherwise known as Netscape), and resulted in the dominance of Internet Explorer and the downfall of Netscape Navigator.
                * By mid-1995, the World Wide Web had gotten a lot of consideration in mainstream society and the broad communications. Netscape Navigator was the most broadly utilized internet browser and Microsoft had authorized Mosaic to make Internet Explorer 1.0, which it had delivered as a feature of the Microsoft Windows 95 Plus 
                * In October 1997, Internet Explorer 4.0 was delivered. The delivery party in San Francisco included a ten-foot-tall letter "e" logo. Netscape representatives appearing for work the next morning discovered the logo on their front yard, with a sign appended that read "From the IE group ...We Love You." The Netscape representatives immediately pushed it over and set a monster figure of their Mozilla dinosaur mascot on it, holding a sign perusing "Netscape 72, Microsoft 18" addressing the market conveyance. 
                * Internet Explorer turned into the new dominant browser, accomplishing a pinnacle of around 96% of the internet browser use share during 2001. 
                * The first browser war finished with Internet Explorer having no leftover genuine contest for its portion of the overall industry. This additionally stopped the fast advancement in internet browsers; until 2006 there was just a single new form of Internet Explorer since variant 6.0 had been delivered in 2001.</p>

            <p> The Second Browser War  is the second war among the top internet browsers. The primary browsers are Internet Explorer, the winner from Browser War I, and newcomers Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and Safari. 
                * Toward the beginning of Netscape Navigator's decay, Netscape has publicly released their browser code, and later shared it with the recently shaped Mozilla Foundation principally local area driven undertaking to make a replacement to Netscape. Advancement has proceeded for a considerable length of time with minimal far and wide reception until a browser-only version, which included new elements, for example, a different hunt bar, was made. The browser-only version was at first named Phoenix, but since of brand name gives that name was changed, first to Firebird, then, at that point, to Firefox. This browser turned into the focal point of the Mozilla Foundation's improvement endeavors and Mozilla Firefox 1.0 was delivered on November 9, 2004. It then, at that point, kept on acquiring an expanding portion of the browser market until a top in 2010. 
                * Future enhancements would be reliant upon Windows Vista, which would incorporate new devices, for example, the WPF and XAML to empower designers to assemble new web applications. 
                * Accordingly, in April 2004, the Mozilla Foundation alongside Opera Software joined endeavors to foster new open-innovation principles which will add greater capacity while staying viable with existing advancements. The aftereffect of this joint effort was the WHATWG that would be submitted to the W3C for endorsement.</p>
