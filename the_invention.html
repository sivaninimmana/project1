            <h1>The Invention Of Internet </h1>
            <h3>WHO INVENTED THE INTERNET?</h3>
            <p>It is difficult to credit the creation of the internet to a single person. The internet was the work of many scientists, programmers and engineers who each grew new features and technologies that in the long run converged to turn into the "information superhighway" we know today. 
              Nikola Tesla toyed with an idea of a "world wireless system" in the early 1900s, and visionary scholars like Paul Otlet and Vannevar Bush conceived of mechanized, searchable storage systems of books and media during the 1930s and 1940s. 
              MIT’s J.C.R. Licklider popularized the idea of an “Intergalactic Network” of computers which shortly developed the concept of “packet switching” that would later become one of the major building blocks of the internet.
              The first workable prototype of the Internet came in the late 1960s with the creation of ARPANET, or the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. Originally funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, ARPANET used packet switching to allow multiple computers to communicate on a single network.
              On October 29, 1969, ARPAnet delivered its first message: a “node-to-node” communication from one computer to another.The message—“LOGIN”—was short and simple, but it crashed the fledgling ARPA network anyway: The Stanford computer only received the note’s first two letters.
              The technology continued to grow in the 1970s after scientists Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf developed Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol.
              ARPANET adopted TCP/IP on January 1, 1983, and from there researchers began to assemble the “network of networks” that became the modern Internet. The online world then took on a more recognizable form in 1990, when computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web.The web helped popularize the internet among the public, and served as a crucial step in developing the vast trove of information that most of us now access on a daily basis.</p>

            <h3>THE SPUTNIK SCARE-</h3>
            <img style='float:left;width:290px;height:260px; margin-right:10px;' src="images/sputnik.webp" />
            <p>On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world's first manmade satellite into space. The satellite, known as Sputnik, didn't do a lot: It relayed blips and bleeps from its radio transmitters as it orbited the Earth. In any case, to numerous Americans, the beach ball-sized Sputnik was evidence of something disturbing: While the most brilliant researchers and specialists in the United States had been planning greater vehicles and better TVs, it appeared, the Soviets had been focusing on less trivial things—and they planned to win the Cold War as a result of it. 
              After Sputnik's launch, many Americans started to contemplate science and innovation. Schools included courses subjects like science, physical science and math. Enterprises took government concedes and put them in logical innovative work. Furthermore, the central government itself framed new offices, like the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), to foster space-age innovations like rockets, weapons and PCs.</p>

            <h3>THE BIRTH OF ARPANET-</h3>
            <img style='float:left;width:250px;height:250px; margin-right:10px;' src="images/birth.jpg" width="20%" height="20%">
            <p> Scientists and military specialists were particularly worried about what may occur in case of a Soviet assault on the country's telephone system. Just one missile they feared could destroy the entire network of lines and wires that made efficient long-distance communication possible.
              In 1962, a researcher from M.I.T. also, ARPA named J.C.R. Licklider proposed an answer for this issue: a "galactic organization" of PCs that could converse with each other. Such an organization would empower government pioneers to convey regardless of whether the Soviets annihilated the phone framework. 
              In 1965, another M.I.T. researcher fostered a method of sending data starting with one PC then onto the next that he called "bundle exchanging." Packet exchanging separates information into squares, or parcels, prior to sending it to its objective. That way, every bundle can take its own course from one spot to another. Without bundle exchanging, the public authority's PC organization—presently known as the ARPAnet—would have been similarly as powerless against adversary assaults as the telephone framework.</p>
            </br></br>

            <h3>THE NETWORK GROWS-</h3>
            <img style='float:left;width:350px;height:300px; margin-right:10px;' src="images/network.jpg"/>
            <p> By the end of 1969, only four PCs were associated with the ARPAnet, however the organization developed consistently during the 1970s. 
              In 1971, it added the University of Hawaii's ALOHAnet, and after two years it added networks at London's University College and the Royal Radar Establishment in Norway. As packet-switched computer networks multiplied, however, it became more difficult for them to integrate into a single worldwide “internet.”
              By the end of1970s, a computer Scientist named Vinton Cerf had started to tackle this issue by fostering a way for each of the PCs on every one of the world's mini-networks to communicate with each other. He called his invention "Transmission Control Protocol," or TCP. (Afterward, he added an extra convention, known as "Web Protocol." The abbreviation we use to allude to these today is TCP/IP.) One writer describes Cerf's convention as "the 'handshake' that acquaints far off and various computers with one another in a virtual space."</p>
            </br></br>

            <h3>THE WORLD WIDE WEB-</h3>
            <p> Cerf's convention changed the internet into a worldwide network. All through the 1980s, analysts and researchers utilized it to send records and information starting with one PC then onto the next. In any case, in 1991 the web changed once more. That year, a software engineer in Switzerland named Tim Berners-Lee presented the World Wide Web: a web that was not just a way of sending documents starting with one spot then onto the next however was itself a "web" of data that anybody on the Internet could recover. Berners-Lee made the Internet that we know today. From that point forward, the web has changed in numerous ways. In 1992, a gathering of understudies and scientists at the University of Illinois fostered a refined program that they called Mosaic. Mosaic offered an easy to understand way of looking through the Web: It permitted clients to see words and pictures in total agreement interestingly and to explore utilizing scrollbars and interactive connections. 
              That very year, Congress concluded that the Web could be utilized for business purposes. Accordingly, organizations of numerous sorts rushed to set up sites of their own, and web based business visionaries started to utilize the web to sell products straightforwardly to clients. All the more as of late, long range interpersonal communication destinations like Facebook have turned into a famous way for individuals, all things considered, to remain associated.</p>
